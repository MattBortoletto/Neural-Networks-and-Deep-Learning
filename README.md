# Neural Network and Deep Learning homeworks

These are my homeworks for the Neural Network and Deep Learning course. The topics are the following:

1. Deep supervised learning: regression and classification;
2. Deep unsupervised learning: convolutional autoencoders, denoising autoencoders, transfer learning, convolutional variational autoencoders;
3. Deep reinforcement learning: deep Q-learning with OpenAI gym environment.
